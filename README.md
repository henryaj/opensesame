# OpenSesame

Sometimes, doors should open themselves.

(I wanted a way to open my front gate remotely, so I built this.)

## Requirements

* server able to run this code
* [Particle](http://particle.io) device or similar (Spark Core, Photon, Electron)

## Setup

* Ensure that your PARTICLE_DEVICE_NAME, PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN and SECRET_CODE are set. Then `rackup`.
* Get a [Twilio](http://twilio.com) number, and ensure that incoming SMS messages POST to `<your-server-address>/open`.
* Send a text to your number containing only your SECRET_CODE.
* Marvel as your door opens.
